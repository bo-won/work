Description: Design for the Brooklyn Rail's April 2025 Critics Page, which is set in the typefaces "I am your worst fear; I am your best fantasy / First Gay American" by Be Oakley (otherwise known as GenderFail) and "THE GODDESS BUNNY" by Nat Pyper. "I am your worst fear; I am your best fantasy / First Gay American" is one of the many open-source fonts that Oakley creates based on protest signs from the protests for queer, trans, and black lives since the Stonewall Riots of 1969 to the present. "THE GODDESS BUNNY" is a font that pays tribute to the late queer Hollywood icon and cult sensation Goddess Bunny, a trans performer and underground legend known for her mesmerizing lip-syncs, tap dancing, and undeniable glamour. The font mimics her original handwriting but replaces each stroke with a series of dancing feet.
